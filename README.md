As Microsoft and their products become more and more garbage and privacy-invasive, I decided to move to Codeberg. All future repositories will be on my Codeberg profile. Please visit my profile at [https://codeberg.org/ZunneCode](https://codeberg.org/ZunneCode) if you want to see my future projects and contribute with me, i will only use this account when im contributing a project that is only on Github, or open an issue on a Github Repository. Bye.

Open source projects will always be my passion.
